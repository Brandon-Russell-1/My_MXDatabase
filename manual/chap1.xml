<chapter><title>The Basics</title>

<para>Before we can get into the really deep parts how this program works we need to understand it on a larger scale. This chapter will cover the functions of this database in a big picture sense, each area will later be expanded on, explaining the inner workings, and why we designed things the way that we did.

<section><title>Automated Data Loading</title>
<para>In order for this application to function properly it needs to be running at all times on at least one machine on the network. This is easily accomplished by making the MOC the updating user. Every 3-7 minutes users that are logged in as MOC will refresh the A4 aircraft status page and update the information for each aircraft in the system. If two users are logged into the database as MOC at the same time the data will be refreshed at a greater rate. The system used to update the database will be explained in greater detail later, but when looking at it from the big picture perspective its only important to remember that information in the database is a <loud>DIRECT</loud> reflection of whats currently on the A4 website.
</para>

<section><title>Manual Additions</title>
<para>
Some information can not be inputted from the A4 page. In a perfect world this application would be capable of pulling information directly from Ge018, but since it can not corrective actions, and DST must be entered by users.
</para>
<para>
The heart and sole of this application is SOEs, and Turnover entries. This is the only place were this information lives and without the database this information would only live as long as the sheet of paper that it was written on. Unlike that paper SOEs and Turnover entries and stored in the database forever and are able to be searched and reviewed. This allows users to quickly see trends and issues outside of the scope of Ge081's histories.
</para>

<section><title>Settings</title>
<para>
Some outside sources need to be setup to work with the database, this section will deal with setting up the A4 page and GDSS.

<section><title>Administration</title>
<para>
The majority of people reading this manual will not need to read this section (that is assuming that anyone will actually read it), but it is included in the same manual so that we don't have to maintain multiple manuals. For the most part this database was designed to be admin-less, however because people are people things still need done now and then. In order to access the admin section the users must be on an access list. This section allows administrators to see faults, usage data, and change links to information like the weather website and where to auto save the Morning Reports to.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Special Circumstances</title>
<para>
In version 2.0 of the database a feature was added to allow manual input when the network is down. It will allow a user to arrive aircraft, add jobs, and anything else that they would normally be able to do. The second special circumstance that will be covered in this section is the setup of a new copy of this database on a network. While this is something that is not likely to be used often it is here for the off chance that someone requires it.
</para>
</section>

<para>Each of the following sections is going to represent what we have talked about above. The only diffrence is that we are going to go much deeper into how things work and why we designed them the way that we did. The end result will hopefully be a very educational experience.</para>
